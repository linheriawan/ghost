#                                 "bottom-left", "bottom-center", "bottom-right"

# How it works:
# - The anchor specifies which point of the SKIN image to position from
# - "top-right" means: start from top-right corner of the skin
# - Then apply offset from that point
anchor = "top-right"

# Offset from anchor point [x, y] in pixels
# For "top-right" anchor:
#   - Positive x = further right (outside skin)
#   - Negative y = above the anchor point
